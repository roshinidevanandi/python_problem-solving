# classes and object

# Class Variable (species): Shared by all instances of the class. Changing Dog.species affects all
#  objects, as itâ€™s a property of the class itself.

# Instance Variables (name, age): Defined in the __init__ method. Unique to each instance 
# (e.g., dog1.name and dog2.name are different).

# Accessing Variables: Class variables can be accessed via the class name (Dog.species) or an 
# object (dog1.species). Instance variables are accessed via the object (dog1.name).

# Updating Variables: Changing Dog.species affects all instances. Changing dog1.name only affects
# dog1 and does not impact dog2.

# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another 
# class (parent class).
